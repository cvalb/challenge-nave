## Description

This project is a challenge created by [nave.rs](https://nave.rs/).
This is also my first project using React and Sass.

## Objective

The challenge's objective was to create a responsive single page application using any framework/library or pure JavaScript, integrating their API.

## 0.1.0

Fully functional.

### To improve
- The employee modal isn't using the show request, as requested by the company. Instead, it uses the clicked employee as an object set to a state;
- When deleting an employee, could not reload the main list. Tried to set state variables to do so;
- Each modal should be a component;
- Refactor functions to be called;
